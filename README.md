HowtoGuide
==========
WELCOME!
For my next assignment I was told to create a How-To app that guides you through multiple 
lists of process. I have to use a special step-by-step sequential instructions to complete a task.
The task I chose was to bake a pie. (Reason for this was that tomorrow 07.23.13 is my birthday and I prefer
pie over cake!) Simple enough.

(What I used): Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and my own special recipe.
